them and kill them all.

VERSION - CONTROL POINT

In the checkpoint game version, every time you surpass
one level, the mode control point will be activated, if
you lose the game, when you restart another, you start from the
point of control, that is, you will start from the level where
You lost the game. In a way, this game mode is the
easier if you want to kill all the UFOs !!!!

You will have to start from the beginning, from the first level.
This game mode is the most difficult, and is only suitable for
