Story
=====
Our friendly dog Moritz has to stay for two weeks in the animal hospital. 
That's no holiday: 
Injections, pills and taking temperature all the time.
Dizzy from all the meds, Moritz is wandering through bizarre dreams. 

What a horrible nightmare!!! He wants to pea but can't touch the trees, just sliding through them.  
Blood sucking vampires, crazy postmen, nasty Santa Claus' are chasing our lovely hero.
But don't despair, he gets help vom Bouncing Bob, the always smiling fellow, who will carry Moritz. 
And maybe he can use a JetPac or a C5!

What is that about the ZX Spectrum thingy, his "owner" is talking all the time? 
Moritz feels like Manic Miner:-) Collect the bones to empower him. 

Can Moritz find his way out and recover?
Guide Moritz through his subconscious voyage. 

"May the bones be with you!"
