THE STORY

The Empire is a large political entity stretching over many lands, populated by different peoples. For years, peace and justice have been assured under the rule of the current Emperor. But now, the Empire is under a major threat: Yojar, an evil sorcerer coming from another dimension, has invaded it. Not only he occupied three major regions with his minions; he also scattered several tokens of power there. They appear as giant skulls and act as beacons of influence from their maker – if they stay for a long enough time, they will allow Yojar to enter our world, and then he will be unstoppable.
The brave Imperial troops are unfortunately unable to withstand the assault of Yojar’s forces. The Emperor summons his ministers and together they take a decision: since conventional weapons cannot fight magic, it must be fought with other magic. An emissary is sent to the Territory of Xixerella, a small, partially autonomous community nested among the mountains on the western fringe of the Empire, where the most powerful wizards of the kingdom can be found.
In Xixerella, magic has been practiced exclusively by women for centuries. It is based upon an ancient wisdom which core is the notion that the Universe, while being one, is driven by the contrast between opposite principles: light and dark, old and young, heat and cold, soft and hard, and so on. Traditionally, only women are allowed to fully master the tremendous power which can be unleashed by learning this doctrine in its deepest aspects. The future wizards are selected a few months after they are born, as soon as the signs of their power appear; for example, they can push objects much heavier than them without touching them, or light fires out of nothing. About one out of every twenty girls shows this power. After a long and strenuous training, they become able to project deadly bolts of energy, temporarily protect themselves from any sort of physical or psychic damage, and even to fly!
The emissary explains the situation to the High Master of Xixerella and her inner circle of wizards, and tells them that His Majesty has requested a member of their Order to infiltrate the enemy lines, repel Yojar’s evil army and save the Empire, and possibly mankind, from being enslaved. Then Sophia, a young and promising wizard, stands up from her seat and volunteers for the mission. Despite the High Master’s attempts to make her recede from her proposal, fearing that, notwithstanding her vastly superior ability in the use of magic, her young age and lack of experience could harm her, Sophia is irremovable. The emissary is impressed by Sophia’s determination and, in the name of the Emperor, officially designates her as the last hope of the Empire. Later, he brings her to the first occupied area.

HOW TO PLAY

The game is divided into four levels, where you play as Sophia. In each of the first three levels, Sophia must find four skulls, beacons of Yojar’s power, and dispose of them by throwing them, one by one, into a cauldron. You can only carry a skull at a time; before picking another one, you must dispose of the other first. Once the fourth skull has been destroyed, you will receive a code for the next level and continue playing until you reach the fourth level or lose all of your lives. In this case, you will start the game from the last level you reached; to play a different level, you will have to enter its code in the code insertion screen.
To dispatch enemies, you must shoot them with bolts of light energy or blobs or dark energy; you toggle between them by pressing the Down key or by pulling the joystick down.
But beware! Some enemies will be unaffected by a certain shot, other might even be transformed into two other ones. You must discover how your foes will react to the two different kinds of energy. Yojar’s troops also placed a series of deadly traps throughout the levels: spinning blades, spiked balls and catapults. Your magic cannot harm them; therefore, you must avoid them at all costs.
You can cast a defensive spell, commonly referred to as a Shield. You start each level with a Shield at your disposal and can only carry one at a time. When cast, the spell will protect you from every threat for a short time.
Shooting costs light or dark mana, and when you deplete the mana for a certain type of energy, you will be unable to shoot it. Every time an enemy is dissolved, you gain a unit of raw mana, which can then be converted into the Wizard Guild’s Hut in order to obtain mana for the offensive spells, the Shield (at a cost of 30 raw mana units) and an extra life (50 raw mana units, only once per level). The Hut stands on chicken’s legs and can be found in each of the first three levels. To convert the raw mana, just touch the relative icons while inside the Hut. You cannot carry more than 50 units of either light or dark mana and 99 of raw mana. When you lose a life, your light and dark mana will be restored to 50 units each.
Some sections of every level will be inaccessible and marked by magic doors bearing the image of a geometrical shape. In order to open them, you must carry the corresponding talisman. There are three of them in total.
When you complete the third level, Yojar’s defenses will be weakened and you will be able to enter his own realm. Here, the atmosphere is saturated with mana, so you won’t have to worry about replenishing your reserves. Of course, there won’t be any Wizard Guild’s Hut either. Your task here will simply (so to speak!) be to find Yojar and defeat him.
The panel in the higher part of the screen will provide you with vital information. The larger icons show, from left to right, the number of lives left, light mana left, dark mana left, raw mana, destroyed skulls so far. The smaller icons on the right will light up when you are carrying a skull, a Shield or the talismans. The six-digit number is your score.

CONTROLS

Sophia can be controlled with the keyboard or with a Kempston or Sinclair joystick.
Default keys are: 
O - left; 
P - right; 
Q - fly; 
A - toggle light/dark mana; 
M - shoot; 
H - cast Shield.

Keys are fully redefinable in the Preferences menu.

THE MENUS

In-game menus are controlled by means of an arrow-shaped cursor which moves by pressing the SPACE key, while options are selected by pressing the ENTER key.
Upon loading, the initial screen will appear, with four icons, from left to right:

- Green traffic light: Start game.
- Pipe wrench: Preferences menu.
- Remote control: Change level.
- Trophy: View high scores table.

In the Preferences menu, you can choose how to control the game. From left to right:

Keyboard/ Kempston joystick/ Sinclair joystick/ Redefine keys. By selecting the Redefine Keys option, the icons on the lower part of the screen will be lit up in the Left/ Right/ Fly/ Down (Toggle)/ Shoot/ Shield order. Press the corresponding key of your choice.
Should you wish to change the current level, you will need to insert the code obtained at the end of the previous level. E.g. if you wish to play the third level, you will have to insert the code obtained at the end of the second. Press the key corresponding to the color of each of the five squares of the sequence according to the scheme shown in the code insertion screen.
The default level is the first; if you wish to play it again after you inserted a code for a different level, just press ENTER as soon as the code insertion screen appears.

HINTS AND TIPS

- Try to learn how enemies are affected by light and dark magic as soon as possible.
- Skulls won’t always appear in the same places.
- Be cautious when passing under spiky balls; approach them slowly while keeping an
  eye on them and turn back as soon as they start falling.
- Catapults are not lethal, but their projectiles are.
- To defeat Yojar, you will need both of your offensive spells.
- There is something we did not tell you about, but we will leave you the pleasure of
  discovering it by yourselves…

TECHNICAL NOTES

The game is compatible with all ZX Spectrums with 128K RAM and is available in the following formats:

- TZX tape image files saved with SetoLOAD turbo loading scheme, for generic
  emulation and loading on real hardware via PC or multimedia reader;
- TAP tape image files, for those emulators which do not support TZX files or use with
  a DivIDE interface and FATware 0.12 and derivates (0.12a, Velesoft etc.);
- multi-language SCL disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface; must be left
  in the drive during play;
- multi-language TRD disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface, or with a
  DivIDE/DivMMC and ESXDOS 0.8.5 and newer; it may also be used with a ZX
  Spectrum 48K/+ equipped with such interfaces (without background music due to
  the lack of the AY-3-8912 sound chip) and must be left in the drive during play.

Please note: if your interface runs ESXDOS 0.8.5 as its operative system, you must highlight the SOPH-EN.TAP file name in the ESXDOS menu, press I then SPACE and load the game by entering the usual LOAD “” command. Otherwise, when typing your name for the high scores table you will be unable to enter anything other than numbers and symbols (with SYMBOL SHIFT). This is due to a bug of the operative system, which has been corrected in ESXDOS 0.8.6 beta 4.

Note for users of Brazilian disk interfaces derived from the Beta Disk (Arcade AR-20, IDS-91, CBI95): The TRD disk image can be used with the Brazilian interfaces; in this case, the Portuguese version will be automatically loaded, showing an introductory screen at the start. The image has been tested successfully under emulation (SpecEmu build 24/12/2018 and ROM images supplied by Victor Trucco).
