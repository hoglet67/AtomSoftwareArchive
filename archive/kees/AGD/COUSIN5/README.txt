Cousin Horace Chapter 3: Sleepyville:
------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to COUSIN HORACE, a new game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48/128, an epic adventure with the following main features:

- Five different chapters for a mix of platform, shoot-‘em-up, puzzle solving and maze exploration.
- An immersive plot illustrated by ‘Spectrumized’ pictures and comic book-like inbetween screens.
- Comes in TZX (Biturbo-II fast loader) and TAP format.
- Game and documentation immediately available in six different languages: Italian, English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese.

But who is Cousin Horace, actually?

The idea came to me by looking at the cassette inlays of the versions of Horace games made for the Timex Sinclair 2068, the American clone of the Spectrum. The character portrayed on them bears very little resemblance to the one we all know and love, although the games themselves are indistinguishable from their Spectrum counterparts.
I then imagined such character not to be the British Horace, but his American cousin – incidentally going by the name of Horace as well – living his same adventures, or a sort of parallel life if you prefer, on the other side of ‘The Pond’. Hence COUSIN HORACE.
Each chapter poses a different challenge for the player, requiring different skills to be negotiated. By successfully ending each one of them (except for the last chapter, of course) the player will receive a code to enter after loading the next one in order to start it.

Have fun!

THE STORY

The two Horaces are currently helping local authorities in their respective countries into investigating an underground network formed by their ancient enemies, the Guardians – an evil secret society bent on world domination – and the Spiders, together with their new allies, the Flying Demons.
One day US-Horace (from now on simply Horace) invites his cousin for a holiday in the States and the two arrange a meeting at the airport. However, the plane from the United Kingdom Horace was waiting for has arrived, but there is no sign of his relative.
All of a sudden, Horace receives a phone call on his mobile. “They got me, cousin! Help!” It is UK-Horace’s voice. Another voice – an unknown, eerie one – intimates Horace to head immediately for a place at the edge of the city, otherwise his cousin won’t survive the day. Of course, he must go alone and not tell anyone about this.
Horace, although being certain he is walking straight into the lion’s den, complies to the request and stops his car in front of a tall, ominous building. He steps in… 

THE CHAPTERS

Chapter 1 - The Tower (platform game)
Horace is now trapped inside the Guardians’ tower. He must reach the top floor and get the key that opens the locker with the Great Power Pill inside (the locker can be seen right above the starting point). By eating the Pill he will be able to knock his enemies out by stomping over them. Then he has to cleanse the whole building of the baddies.
The two counters below the play area show Horace’s energy and the number of enemies defeated. Notice that eating the Pill does not make Horace invulnerable – enemies can still hurt him if he does not hit them properly. First aid kits will restore 5 units of energy.
Stay away from the spikes and do not touch the radioactive waste barrels!

Chapter 2 - The Flight (horizontally scrolling shoot-‘em-up)
After getting rid of his enemies, Horace finds evidence that the Guardians are building secret outposts throughout the USA and that his cousin has been brought to a small town called Sleepyville. Having found a helicopter on the roof of the tower, he decides to go there at once, but just a few seconds after taking off, he is attacked by swarms of remote-controlled explosive drones. Luckily the helicopter is equipped with a cannon which can be powered up by collecting the ‘POW’ tokens placed along the way.
He must then fly over four landscapes – city, countryside, mountains and desert – before arriving at Sleepyville, while keeping an eye at the helicopter’s fuel level, replenished by collecting fuel tanks.

Chapter 3 - Sleepyville (exploration arcade adventure)
At Sleepyville, Horace must find a way to discover the Guardians’ base, where his cousin is held captive. He will have to interact with several other characters and use different objects.
Unfortunately Sleepyville is currently hosting the annual national convention of the Pink Devils, a club of speed-obsessed bikers that can be found almost everywhere in town! Other risks come in the form of the local Giant Scorpions, Tumbleweed and a particularly dangerous species of vulture. Every contact with them will deduct one unit of energy (two in case of contact with the Crazy Vultures) from the bar placed below the playing area. If energy drops to zero, Horace dies and the game ends.
In order to replenish his energy, Horace must go the hospital and enter the Fast-Aid area, a state-of-the-art medical facility. A fee of $10 will be deducted from his account. Should he remain without money, he won’t be able to receive medical care. Horace starts with $30 (he left his wallet and credit card home!).

Chapter 4 - The Base (maze game)
Horace has penetrated the enemy base, still under construction, and found his cousin captive into a cell. He tells him that this is the new core of the Guardians’ operations. The only way to release him is to find five diskettes, parts of an emergency code which, once entered into the main computer in the central zone, will shut the system down and unlock the cell door.
Horace will then have to go back to the starting point.
To defend himself from the Assassin Robots and Cyber-Guardians roaming the place, Horace may use the nail guns left there by workmen completing the structure and deflect deadly laser beams with barrels he can move for that purpose. Each nail gun comes with 30 nails – you can carry a maximum of 99 of them.
Collect keys to open doors and first aid kits to restore 10 units of energy. Beware of the pools of radioactive slime!

Chapter 5 - Together (action/puzzle)
The two cousins are fleeing from the base… what could possibly go wrong now?

HOW TO PLAY

Horace can be controlled with the keyboard, or a Kempston/Sinclair joystick, except for Chapter 2 where, due to the limitations of the SEUD engine, the Kempston joystick option is absent; you may only use the keyboard or a Sinclair joystick (for the same reason, sound effects for that chapter are AY-only). 

Keys are:

- O - left
- Q - up
- SPACE - jump/fire/inventory
- H - hold
- P - right
- A - down
- M - fire (Chapter 2 only)/pick up/choose

HINTS AND TIPS

- Chapter 1: Save the first aid kits for when you really need them.
- Chapter 2: Try to memorize the attack patterns of drones.
- Chapter 3: Some objects will only appear after a certain action has been performed.
- Chapter 4: You will face continuous attacks while in the central zone, so try to spare your ammunition for it, and avoid as much as possible contact with foes in the rest of the base instead of eliminating them.
