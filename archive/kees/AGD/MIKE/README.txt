Story
=====
Mike,the little guitar, has a big wish: To play a solo! 
His favourite band is Nirvana, so he wants to perform "Smells like teen spirit"!
Attention: Jealous instruments and old "Ludwig van" want to stop his mission.
Avoid them, don't touch...
These grinches put the plectrums behind walls. But wait, they forget one plectrum. 
Soon Mike noticed: Everytime he plays the guitar with a plectrum somewhere else a wall breaks down and he can take the next plectrum.
Help Mike to collect 8 plectrums. After that lead him to the loudspeaker.
He will connect and play his favourite song.
Please note, Mike is low on memory. Collect Batteries to give him more strength, so you will lose a life, when the enemies get you, but you don't lose the game.
You only have to start form the first screen. But no worry, Mike keeps all the plectrums he collected so far.

Have Fun!!!!!
