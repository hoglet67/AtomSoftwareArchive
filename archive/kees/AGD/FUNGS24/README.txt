THE SCENARIO
The prosper village of Fungiland has peacefully thrived for centuries, trading with the nearby communities. The Fungi are easy-going folks, living upon their work. But now they are going to face the hardest time of their history…
In a remote corner of a large Japanese city, a heap of old ceramics tableware, dumped among other garbage by the personnel of a local little eatery, due to a mysterious charm begins to stick together in a grotesque form… with a life of its own! Seto Taisho is born, a strange being which, embittered for having been discarded by humans, looks for a new place to live. Wandering around the world, it meets other bizarre entities, persuading them to follow it in its conquest plan… until it reaches the outskirts of Fungiland.
Aware of the incoming invasion, the Fungi gather in the main square trying to find a way to stop Seto Taisho and his army. Rescue might come from the Spinning Star, the visible sign of a strong magic energy which their ancestors knew how to utilize, but no one is nowadays able to handle… except for one of them:

FUNKY FUNGUS!
Employed as a defense weapon in the beginning of Fungiland’s history, the Star has been put aside during the long years of absence of any conflict. Only the Fungus family was granted the privilege to keep practicing the Magic Way of the Star, a collection of rites which allow the casting of the Star’s energy against non-Fungi. Funky Fungus is the current Champion of the Way; rather eccentric even for a varied people like the Fungi (he always wears sunglasses and when he is off from work, he loves to play bass guitar in the local soul/funk band, The Fun Guys), he is nonetheless held in the highest esteem by his peers. Unfortunately, there is no time for Funky Fungus to teach the other Fungi how to use the power of the Star: he must immediately confront the invaders and defeat them… alone.

THE ENEMIES

MUNACIELLO
Country of origin: Italy
‘O Munaciello is the small spirit in a monk’s robe infesting many houses in Naples. 
He loves wealth and is following Seto Taisho hoping to grab some new treasures.

SACI PERERE
Country of origin: Brazil
The hopping one-legged sprite, heavy pipe smoker, loves playing practical jokes and for this reason is always looking for new victims. The peaceful Fungi look like ideal targets to him, thus it was not hard for Seto Taisho to enroll him in its army.

JACK ‘O LANTERN
Country of origin: Ireland
Poor Jack is no more able to scare anyone; even children mock it as a “Halloween pumpkin”. It joined Seto Taisho with the aim of regaining its ancient prestige.

TROLL
Country of origin: Norway
The mighty Troll roams around the forest, crushing with his heavy mass everything he meets. Annoyed with the ever-increasing presence of humans (and of their reinforced concrete buildings), he followed Seto Taisho to be able to cause some unrestricted mayhem. If he faces Funky Fungus and stays at the same level as him, he will throw him axes.

KARAKASA
Country of origin: Japan
Like Seto Taisho, Karakasa is an old object – namely a straw umbrella – angry for having been thrown away. Its only eye and long tongue are the features making it immediately recognizable.

BABA YAGA
Country of origin: Russia
Baba Yaga is a witch flying aboard a large mortar, where she mixes the ingredients for her concoctions. Seto Taisho promised her the power of the Spinning Star in exchange for her assistance.

SETO TAISHO
Country of origin: Japan
Without its allies, Seto Taisho will defend against Funky Fungus by letting plates and cups fall upon his head. It is a formidable enemy, but it has a weak point somewhere, too…

THE GAME
The adventure spans across four Worlds of twelve screens each, plus a final screen for the battle against Seto Taisho. In each screen Funky Fungus must collect the Spinning Star in order to acquire its power and attack the enemies there. The Star’s energy does not kill the foes, but sends them back to their place of origin after they have been hit a certain number of times. When all of them are banned, the next screen follows. At the same time, the power of the Star will run out and Funky Fungus will have to collect it again.
Funky Fungus starts with five lives, shown under his image on the right of the screen. After not having been used for centuries, the Star’s energy has become unstable. Funky Fungus has a limited amount of time to use it, and if the time reaches zero before he expels all of the enemies from the screen, he will lose a life. Contact with an enemy will cost him a life as well.

Every now and then, a disappearing foe will leave an item which will stay on screen for a short time:

SUPERCHARGE. Considerably enhances the power of the Star.
HOURGLASS. Resets the time count back to 99.
JUMPING LITTLE FUNGUS. Grants a life to Funky Fungus.
LAUGHING SKULL. Makes Funky Fungus lose a life.

Upon completing the twelfth screen, you will receive the code to access the following World, then the game will continue. Funky Fungus may have a maximum of nine lives. If all of them are lost, the game ends. If you do not choose another World, the game will restart from the last reached screen of the current World with five lives and zero points.

CONTROLS
Funky Fungus can be controlled with the keyboard or with a Kempston or Sinclair joystick. Default keys are: O - left; P -right; Q - jump; M - fire; H - pause. Keys are fully redefinable in the Preferences menu.

THE MENUS
In-game menus are controlled by means of an arrow-shaped cursor which moves by pressing the SPACE key, while options are selected by pressing the ENTER key.
Upon loading, the initial screen will appear, with four icons, from left to right:

- Green traffic light: Start game.
- Pipe wrench: Preferences menu.
- Remote control: Choose a World for playing.
- Trophy: View high scores table.

In the Preferences menu, you can choose how to control the game. From left to right: Keyboard/ Kempston joystick/ Sinclair joystick/ Redefine keys. By selecting the Redefine Keys option, the icons on the lower part of the screen will be lit up in the Left/ Right/ Up/ Down/ Fire/ Pause order. Press the corresponding key of your choice.
Should you wish to change the current World, you will need to insert the code obtained at the end of the previous World. E.g. if you wish to play the third World, you will have to insert the code obtained at the end of the second. Press the key corresponding to the color of each of the five squares of the sequence according to the scheme shown in the code insertion screen. The default World is the first; if you wish to play it again after you inserted a code for a different World, just press ENTER as soon as the code insertion screen appears.

TECHNICAL NOTES
The game is compatible with all ZX Spectrums with 128K RAM and is available in the following formats:

- TZX tape image files saved with SetoLOAD turbo loading scheme, for generic emulation and loading on real hardware via PC or multimedia reader;
- TAP tape image files, for those emulators which do not support TZX files or use with a DivIDE interface and FATware 0.12 and derivates (0.12a, Velesoft etc.);
- multi-language SCL disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface; must be left in the drive during play;
- multi-language TRD disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface, or with a DivIDE/DivMMC and ESXDOS 0.8.6 and newer; it may also be used with a ZX Spectrum 48K/+ equipped with such interfaces (without background music due to the lack of the AY3-8912 sound chip) and must be left in the drive during play.

Note for users of Brazilian disk interfaces derived from the Beta Disk (Arcade AR-20, IDS-91, CBI-95): The TRD disk image can be used with the Brazilian interfaces; in this case, the Portuguese version will be automatically loaded, showing an introductory screen at the start. The image has been tested successfully under emulation (SpecEmu 3.1 build 27/02/2020 and ROM images supplied by Victor Trucco).
