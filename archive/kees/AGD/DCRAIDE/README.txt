Deepcore Raider:
----------------

(c) copyright Paul Jenkinson 2016

The universe is huge, the planets and moons numerous and the minerals hidden therein possible unlimited.
It is little wonder then, that evolved species value these commodities highly, and that many people set off in search of riches.
Large corporations compete with small teams and individuals to locate and mine these stellar bodies.
Many have been visited before, and those discovered by the large corporations are littered with defences to protect their investment until their mining teams can reach them.
For individuals, these are high earners. All the evaluation and research has been done, and all the minerals are ust sat there waiting to be taken. That is, if they can get past the defences.
This small breed of individual, interstellar pirates, thieves, are named Deep Core Raiders.

The Game
--------
Control your pod and navigate deeper into the planets to collect any minerals you can find.

Fuel can be replenished in certain caverns.
Gravity can be you friend is you use it right!
