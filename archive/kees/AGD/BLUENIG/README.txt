AGENT BLUE - Nighttime missions:
--------------------------------

THE GAME

This is a typical arcade game for Spectrum 48K (no music) / 128K (with AY music) made using AGDX (a modified version of Arcade Game Designer 4.7) and AGDMusicizer II.
The main character - the player - is Agent Blue.

GAME ACTION

The game is divided into 2 parts (2 files), corresponding to daytime rescue missions (1 to 10) and nighttime (11 to 20).
Each part has 10 playable levels, corresponding to 10 rescue missions that Agent Blue has to carry out.
In each mission, Agent Blue must rescue the respective hostage from the clutches of his abductors.
Thus, the Blue Agent will have to go through the captivity facilities, pick up keys to open the respective doors and finally release and drive the hostage to the escape car.
The escape car will appear when Agent Blue has released the hostage and has collected the 3 envelopes that contain the code for the next mission and that are scattered around the premises.
Blue Agent starts the mission with 5 lives and 3 bullets (projectiles / ammunition) in his pistol, but he can collect sets of 3 bullets that are scattered around the scene of the action.
But Agent Azul's task is not made any easier.
In captivity you will find kidnappers, also armed and who do not ask for permission to shoot him.
Each shot that hits him takes 25% of his life.
Upon reaching 0, the player loses 1 life and the mission is restarted.
The hostage, on the other hand, when shot, dies. The player resumes the mission with 1 less life.
To avoid being hit, both the Blue Agent and the hostage (if next to him) can lower themselves to the ground, a position that does not prevent the Blue Agent from shooting at the bandits.
If the Blue Agent or the fleeing hostage is caught by one of the bandits, the mission is started again and the player will lose 1 life.
Care must also be taken with the cutting blades that instantly kill both Agent Blue and the hostage if they touch them.
Result? Mission restarted and minus 1 life.
Losing all lives, the game is over.
In the lower right corner you can see the portrait of Agent Blue and the hostage.
Between the two is a column that is being filled with question marks [?], One for each envelope collected.
In the end, when Blue Agent and hostage are safe in the escape car, the code for the next mission will appear in place of the question marks [?] (Useful, in case you want to interrupt the game without having to go back to the beginning to start over).
The code for the first mission is MMM
Under the portraits, the player's vital energy, the number of lives and the number of ammunition.
