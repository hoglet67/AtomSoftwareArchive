Chiquito:
---------

The recent Polybius label, with our friend Manu Sevilla at the helm, has a devilish creative rhythm. Today, to " They called him Trinidad " and "Spektrum: the day of the dead" , we add a pleasant launch in tribute to Chiquito de la Calzada: " Chiquito: sinner of the prairie ".

It is a tribute to the figure of Don Gregorio Esteban Sánchez Fernández from Malaga, known to all as Chiquito de la Calzada. Beyond the endearing character of the tribute, we find a hilarious game, very playable, addictive like few others and filled with representative elements of such an important figure of humor in Spain.

One factor that will soon catch your attention is listening to their digitized voices (Ahorarrr, No puedor, etc). We have always loved the digitized voices in the Spectrum but if it is also Chiquito who speaks to us, the sensations are indescribable.

This is his game system: «If you were born after the pains, with this system you will learn chiquitistani incarnating the great one of the road, while dodging torpedoes to the supreme level of the sinner of the prairie. Letters will appear on your right in a column that you must match (only once) with the word on your left. Be careful, because some milestones will also fall. The letters, in addition to the cairns, will pile up and you run the risk that your diuodeno will jaaarl if you don't pick them up, and blow them up with a torpedo. Good luck and to the ataaaaquerr. "

Anyone who lived through the 90s will remember many things from those years when it was believed that in the imminent year 2000 we were all going to die for the 2000 Effect. They will remember techno music, TeleCinco's free nudes, Jesús Gil in the jacuzzi, Little Warriors and Brad Pitt being seduced by horny cartoons. Not quite the most memorable of the 90s was the irruption of Chiquito de la Calzada, a musical artist who was also funny, who became known on television comedy shows such as Genio and Figura or No te laugh that is worse.

Unfortunately Don Gregorio Esteban Sánchez Fernández passed away in 2017 and on this 3rd anniversary the independent and retro programmer known as Polybius Soft (formed by Manu Sevilla) paid tribute by launching for freeChiquito: Prairie Sinner for ZX Spectrum. From the web you can download this title of puzzles and patience as well as a cover to save it on a cassette and add it to our retro-collection.

As the official synopsis reads: "If you were born after the pain, with this system you will learn chiquitistani incarnating the great one of the road, while dodging torpedoes to the supreme level of the sinner of the prairie. To your right will appear letters in a column that you must fit (only once) with the word on your left. Be careful, because some milestones will also fall. The letters, in addition to the milestones, will pile up and you run the risk that your diuodeno will jaaarl if you don't pick them up, and pop them with a torpedo. Good luck and the ataaaaquerr.
