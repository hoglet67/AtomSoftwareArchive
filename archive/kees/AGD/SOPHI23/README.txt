THE STORY

Two years after the defeat of the evil sorcerer Yojar, the small Autonomous Principality of
Xixerella, administrated in the name of the Emperor by princess-magician Sophia, is one of
the most prosperous parts of the Empire. Thanks to the policy of peace and tolerance
promoted by Sophia, several philosophical and religious creeds coexist in Xixerella.

One group in particular, the Society of the Inner Light, is widespread. It ostensibly aims to
strenghten individual well-being through group meditation practices. After some time
however strange rumors begin to circulate about what goes on in the tall tower, built by the
members of the Society as their seat. Word has it that occult rites are performed there, with
human beings turned into monsters, and that lethal machinery watches the place against
intruders. Besides, cases of people mysteriously disappeared some time after joining the
Society are reported.

One night, a guard patrol stumbles upon a horrendous and hostile creature, a sort of
enormous red spider. Reinforcements are called and the soldiers, not without effort, manage
to capture the beast and bring it before Sophia. She immediately senses an evil aura coming
from the creature. Getting to work at once, she creates a spell that, once cast upon the
monster, turns it into its original shape: a Society member who had disappeared that night. 
Questioned by Sophia, the man reports that he does not remember anything, except taking
part to a collective rite performed by the Society in the tower.

Further investigations carried out by secret agents infiltrated by Sophia inside the Society
reveal the truth. The Society is nothing but a gigantic front, behind which an obscure entity
known as Grim Reaper hides. He exploits the life force of people, to boost his might, as well
as to build and supply energy to deadly fighting machines, which he plans to unleash in
order to take over the whole Empire. Under his influence, Society members lose their
humanity and are consumed, sometimes up to their death.

Sophia then decides to wear her robes again and turn to action. An all-out attack is out of
the question – Imperial forces would risk to be annihilated. Sophia will have to penetrate
the tower crossing a dungeon and an underwater passage, finally confronting the Grim
Reaper face to face. Once again, the fate of Xixerella and the Empire falls upon her shoulders.

HOW TO PLAY

The game is divided into three levels, where you play as Sophia. In every level you will find
deadly foes, magical doors to open in order to continue the exploration and a final enemy
boss you will have to defeat by casting spells upon a weak spot it will be up to you to find.

The parchment on the right side of the screen provides you with vital information. The icons
show, from top to bottom, the number of lives left, health left, mana left and of collected or
destroyed items so far. The six-digit number is your score.

At the end of the first and of the second level you will receive a code for the next level and
continue playing until you complete the game or lose all of your lives. In this case, you will
start the game from the last level you reached; to play a different level, you will have to
enter its code in the code insertion screen. An exception to this is the “Princess” difficulty
level (see below).

Level One - The Dungeon

The dungeon is a large subterranean maze where Sophia must find four relics stolen by the
Grim Reaper in ancient times: a parchment, a chalice, an ankh and a hourglass. Collecting
them all will open the door leading to the lair of the Spider Queen, a manifestation of the
Grim Reaper’s power acting as a guardian to the exit.

The dungeon is populated by monsters, which are nothing but Society members subdued
by the Grim Reaper. After many studies and researches, Sophia was finally able to develop
a spell that not only turns the monsters back into humans, but also brings them back to their
homes. The creatures must be hit three times in order for the spell to work. Every contact
with them will decrease Sophia’s health; she will lose a life if it drops to zero. Casting a spell
costs one unit of mana. Every time a relic is collected, Sophia’s health and mana will be fully
restored.

Once neutralized, enemies could leave a magical object behind. Such objects will help or
hinder Sophia:
- LIFE CRYSTAL - Gives Sophia 5 health units.
- YIN-YANG - Gives Sophia 10 mana units.
- SHIELD - Makes Sophia invulnerable for a short time.
- POISONOUS MUSHROOM - Reduces Sophia’s health to 1.
- LAUGHING SKULL - Makes Sophia drop every item she is carrying (if any) and
sends her back to the starting point.
Magical objects remain on the spot until Sophia does not collect them, or she leaves the
current screen.

Apart from the beasts, Sophia must also beware the magical mobile barriers, against which
the spell has no effect, and the cursed bones of those Society members whose life force has
completely been absorbed by the Grim Reaper. She must not touch them, otherwise her
health will rapidly diminish.

Some sections will be inaccessible and marked by magic doors bearing the image of a
geometrical shape: a triangle, a circle or a square. To open them, Sophia must carry the
corresponding talisman. If she touches the doors, she will be sent back to the starting point
and lose a life.

Level Two - The Underwater Passage

The underwater passage connects the dungeon to a secondary access to the tower. The
animals living there would normally be harmless, but the Grim Reaper made them hostile
with his evil aura and now they attack every being not contaminated by his influence.
Luckily they are vulnerable to Sophia’s spell, but four hits will be required in order to
neutralize them. As a further means of defense, the Grim Reaper made his followers place
mines that will explode upon contact with Sophia or her spell. In this case, Sophia will
immediately lose a life. Sophia must also avoid contact with the poisonous seaweed
scattered around the passage at all costs.

Sophia can swim, and thanks to her powers she can hold her breath for a long time, but the
effort required makes her health constantly drop. In order to restore it to its maximum level,
she must inhale the healthy vapors released from a crack in the rock found near to the
starting point.

Sophia must find four amulets, beacons of the Grim Reaper’s power, and dispose of them
by throwing them, one by one, into an underwater volcano lying somewhere in the passage.
She can only carry one amulet at a time; before picking another one, you must dispose of
the other first. When Sophia carries an amulet, the indicator placed in the lower part of the
scroll will flash. Destroying an amulet will release a massive amount of mana, so that
Sophia’s will be fully restored. When the fourth amulet is destroyed, the portcullis leading
to the exit will open. The exit is guarded by the Giant Seahorse and his offspring.

Once neutralized, enemies could leave a magical object behind. Such objects will help or
hinder Sophia:
- YIN-YANG - Gives Sophia 10 mana units.
- SHIELD - Makes Sophia invulnerable for a short time.
- LAUGHING SKULL - Makes Sophia drop every item she is carrying (if any) and sends her back to the starting point.
Magical objects remain on the spot until Sophia does not collect them, or she leaves the
current screen.

Some sections will be inaccessible and marked by magic doors bearing the image of a
geometrical shape: a triangle, a circle or a square. To open them, Sophia must carry the
corresponding talisman. If she touches the doors, she will be sent back to the starting point
and lose a life.

Level Three - The Tower

The seat of the Society is the place where the Grim Reaper had his fearful war machines
built and activated: spikes on wheels, androids with powerful claws instead of hands,
bouncing robots. Against them, Sophia cannot use magic, and must therefore rely on her
agility and reflexes, also because the magical aura of the Grim Reaper prevents her from
flying. Sophia will then have to jump and use the ladders and moving platforms to get
around the tower.

The place is peppered with environmental dangers as well: acid pools emanating harmful
fumes, blazing or one-way floors, weights falling as soon as Sophia walks below them, 

spinning blades, sharp points and cannons. In this level there is no way to restore Sophia’s
health and mana, so be very careful! Mana will only be useful at the end, when, once she
reaches the top of the tower, Sophia will have to defeat the Grim Reaper. He will send his
astral projection against her.

Some sections will be barred by impenetrable magical barriers. Sophia can deactivate them
by pulling down the levers placed around the tower. If Sophia touches the barriers, she will
be sent back to the starting point and lose a life.

CONTROLS

Sophia can be controlled with the keyboard or with a Kempston or Sinclair joystick. Default keys are: O - left; P - right; Q - up; A - down; M - fire; H - pause. Keys are fully redefinable in the Preferences menu.

THE MENUS

In-game menus are controlled by means of an arrow-shaped cursor which moves by pressing the SPACE key, while options are selected by pressing the ENTER key.

Upon loading, the initial screen will appear, with four icons, from left to right:
- Green traffic light: Start game.
- Pipe wrench: Preferences menu.
- Remote control: Change level.
- Trophy: View high scores table.

In the Preferences menu, you can choose how to control the game. From left to right:
Keyboard/ Kempston joystick/ Sinclair joystick/ Redefine keys. By selecting the Redefine
Keys option, the icons on the lower part of the screen will be lit up in the Left/ Right/ Up/ Down / Fire/ Pause order. Press the corresponding key of your choice. After selecting your control method, you must choose between two difficulty levels:
- Magician: this is the normal level, where you can hold a maximum of 50 health units and 99 mana units, and you can start the game from any of the three levels (providing you know the access codes for them!).
- Princess: a real challenge! You can hold a maximum of 30 health units and 65 mana units, and must start the game always from the first level, no matter if you previously selected a different one. At the end of the game you will be rewarded with 10,000 bonus points and an alternative ending.
If you are satisfied with your choices, select the ? symbol, otherwise ? to start again.

Should you wish to change the current level, you will need to insert the code obtained at the end of the previous level. E.g. if you wish to play the third level, you will have to insert the code obtained at the end of the second. Press the key corresponding to the color of each of the five squares of the sequence according to the scheme shown in the code insertion screen.
The default level is the first; if you wish to play it again after you inserted a code for a different level, just press ENTER as soon as the code insertion screen appears.

HINTS AND TIPS

- Try to memorize the paths through each level.
- In the first two levels, try to avoid foes as much as possible, in order to save mana.
- Neither relics nor amulets will always appear in the same places.
- The shield won’t let you pass through the magical doors.
- There is something we did not tell you about, but we will leave you the pleasure of discovering it by yourselves…

TECHNICAL NOTES

The game is compatible with all ZX Spectrums with 128K RAM and is available in the following formats:
- TZX tape image files saved with SetoLOAD turbo loading scheme, for generic emulation and loading on real hardware via PC or multimedia reader;
- TAP tape image files, for those emulators which do not support TZX files or use with a DivIDE interface and FATware 0.12 and derivates (0.12a, Velesoft etc.);
- multi-language SCL disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface; must be left in the drive during play;
- multi-language TRD disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface, or with a DivIDE/DivMMC and ESXDOS 0.8.5 and newer; it may also be used with a ZX Spectrum 48K/+ equipped with such interfaces (without background music due to the lack of the AY-3-8912 sound chip) and must be left in the drive during play.

Please note: if your interface runs ESXDOS 0.8.5 as its operative system, you must highlight the SOPH2-EN.TAP file name in the ESXDOS menu, press I then SPACE and load the game by entering the usual LOAD “” command. Otherwise, when typing your name for the high scores table you will be unable to enter anything other than numbers and symbols (with SYMBOL SHIFT). This is due to a bug of the operative system, which has been corrected in ESXDOS 0.8.6 beta 4.

Note for users of Brazilian disk interfaces derived from the Beta Disk (Arcade AR-20, IDS-91, CBI95): The TRD disk image can be used with the Brazilian interfaces; in this case, the
Portuguese version will be automatically loaded, showing an introductory screen at the start. The image has been tested successfully under emulation (SpecEmu build 24/12/2018 and ROM images supplied by Victor Trucco).
