THE UNOFFICIAL ZOMBO'S CHRISTMAS CAPERS:
----------------------------------------

He's back, and this time it's Christmas! Zombo returns in this brand new completely unofficial game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum! Now featuring 76% less game-breaking bugs than the first game in the series!

What's that you say? You can't be bothered fiddling with emulators? Now you don't have to, as it comes bundled with a version that'll run on your PC without having to set anything up!

THE PLOT

Centuries of overwork and stress have finally taken their toll - Santa™ has suffered a psychotic break and gone missing from his workshop in North Renfrewshire. The Government™ have tasked Zombo™ with tracking down Mr. Claus™ and retrieving the gifts for all the good little boys and girls™. Luckily, the naughty list is rather long these days, so he only needs to find a total of six presents.

GAMEPLAY

You must retrieve 6 presents and defeat the end of game baddy to win. Colour coded keys are scattered around, as are several other items, some of which are useful, others of which are not, but there's a Shootybang 2000™ somewhere which'll probably come in handy, (please bear in mind that the Shootybang 2000™ can only fire horizontally).
