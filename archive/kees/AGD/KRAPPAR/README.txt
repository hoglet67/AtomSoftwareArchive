Krappark:
---------

THE GAME

This is an action arcade/adventure game for Spectrum 48K (without music)/128K (with AY music) made using Arcade Game Designer 4.7 and AGDMusicizer II.

The main character is Jason Polton.

He offered his girlfriend, Paula, a nice necklace.
However, a group of ruffians stole them as she strolled through Krap Park.

So Jason went to her to retrieve the necklace.

PLAYING THE GAME

The game has 43 playable rooms.

The objective of the game is to retrieve Paula's necklace.
So, the first thing to do is find the rascals.

When Jason finds the leader of the ruffians, he asked for his girlfriend's necklace.

But the ruffian tells him he must bring him some objects and give him some money to give back the necklace:

$100
1 pick
1 shovel
1 garden shears
1 bikini
1 sexy dress
1 pair of handcuffs
1 pair of police sunglasses
2 bottles of whisky
It's the ruffian girlfriend's birthday and he want tomake it unforgetable.

»» During the game play, Jason cannot pick up objects or talk to anyone until he talks to the leader of the ruffians first. ««

So, what can Jason must do to complete his job?

$100
Jason starts the game with $ 20 in his pocket.

Then he have two chances to accumulate more money in order to reach $ 100:
- pick up the 8 $10 that are scattered throughout the park.
- "rob" the women who are in the park who, each time, who does, adds $ 10.

However, Jason will have to spend some money on acquiring bottles of whisky ($ 20 each).
And even if the drunk does not give him a bottle, Jason goes without $ 10.
The more times this happens, the more often it will have to "rob" the women in the park.

1 pick
Caution!
The pick is in a dangerous place, in contact with electrical wires.
Jason will have to search for a pair of insulating gloves.

But to access the places where the gloves are (they're separeted), he will have to pass through the 2 dogs.
And to get past the dogs, Jason will have to find the 2 bones that are buried in the northern part of the park.

And to dig them up, Jason must have the shovel in his possession.
To dig, the player stands next to the small mound and press the Action key.

1 shovel
Just look for it and pick it up.

1 garden shears
To get to the place where the scissors are, Jason will have to find the ruffian's lost watch, which has lost him in one of the countless rubbish bins scattered around the park.

To search, the player just touches the garbage bins and press the Action key. 

1 bikini
To get a bikini, look for one of the women in a bikini, lean on her and press the Action key.

But be careful!
The woman lies naked and screams for help.
Park guards trigger the alarm and Jason will have to find the alarm deactivation device (to deactivate the alarm, just touch the device and press the Action key).

In addition to the bikini, Jason pulls out $ 10 from her.

1 sexy dress
To get a sexy dress, look for one of the women dressed in a sexy dress, lean on her and press Fire button.

But be careful!
The woman lies naked and screams for help.
Park guards trigger the alarm and Jason will have to find the alarm deactivation device (to deactivate the alarm, just touch the device and press Fire button).

In addition to the dress, Jason pulls out $ 10 from her.

1 pair of handcuffs
