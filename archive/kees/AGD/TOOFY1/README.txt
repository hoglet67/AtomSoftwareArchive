Toofy In Fan Land:
------------------

Oh no! Someone has stolen all Toofy’s nuts and scattered them in a strange and mysterious maze in the weird and distant Fan Land.
Toofy must have his nuts and so sets off to Fan Land to retrieve them.
When he gets there though, his world is turned upside-down – literally! 
Guide Toofy in search of his forty nuts scattered about Fan Land, and keep an eye out for secret rooms – not that you can see them – they’re secret after all!

A = Down
O = Left
P = Right
You can also use a Kemptson joystick.

This game should load and run on any standard ZX Spectrum with 48k or more memory.

This game has been created with AGD (Arcade Games Designer) written by Jonathan Cauldwell.
