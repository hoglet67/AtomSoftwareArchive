Information

Welcome to the dimension of the NARGs!
Foggy is just your common-o-garden tourist. 
The only difference is he takes his holidays in other dimensions! 
One sunny day he decided to take a trip to a previously unexplored dimension.
Dimension 52b.
On arrival Foggy was set upon by the NARGs. 
They craved the power of his ships Tri-Crystal Prismatic Phase Engine! 
They ripped out the crystals and then a vital engine part “The Dimension Splicer”. 
In the frenzy Foggy escaped into the Dungeon-like caves.
Find the Crystals, Find the Splicer and Find the Ship!
This holiday will definately get a bad Trip Advisor score!

The Plot

Controls are simple.  Q - Up  A - Down  O - Left  P - Right  SPACE - Jump  I - Inventory.

To use the items you find around the world, you must use an Object Pad. 
A Blue particle patch rising from the floor. 
Stand on these and press 'I' and so long as you have items a menu will appear. 
Use up and down keys to choose an item and press SPACE to 'use' that item. 
If you're in the right place to use it, you'll solve a piece of the puzzle. :-) 
Simply run into objects to collect them. 
Do not touch the NARGs you will die instantly, as will dropping into Lava.
