CRONOPIOS Y FAMAS:
------------------

A game by Alessandro Grussu for the 48K ZX Spectrum, inspired by the book Cronopios and Famas
by Argentine writer Julio Cortázar and developed with the following tools:

• Arcade Games Designer 4.2
• Beepola 1.06.01
• HiSoft BASIC 1.2
• Retro-X Alpha 7
• Spectaculator 8.0
• Tapir release 09/06/07 19:50
• ZX Blockeditor 2.2.1
• ZX Editor SE 2.2
• ZX Paintbrush 2.3

The game uses Einar Saukas’s “Smart RCS-ZX7” data compression algorithm and “Kobrahsoft
SL3” loading scheme (TZX files only).

Some graphic elements have been readapted from the following titles: Army Moves, Crime Busters,
Double Take, Everyone’s A Wally, Helter Skelter, Jail Break, Olli And Lissa III. Graphics in fileteado style
are mainly based upon the works of Alfredo Genovese (website: http://www.fileteado.com).

Music inspired by the following songs: El Choclo (Ángel Villoldo), Caminito (Juan de Dios Filiberto/
Gabino Coria Peñaloza), Mi Buenos Aires Querido (Carlos Gardel/ Alfredo Le Pera).

Translations: Alessandro Grussu (English, German, Spanish), Patrice Arone (French), Marcus
Vinicius Garrett Chiado (Portuguese). Language advice: Gerhard Jungsberger (German), Lilita
Pizzi (Spanish).

CAST OF CHARACTERS

Among Cortázar’s most bizarre and meaningful creations, cronopios and famas symbolize two
opposite and complementary qualities of human existence. Both of them are pervaded by a vein of
humor and folly.

CRONOPIOS
Little round green beings, cronopios are intuitive dreamers, not very tidy and
inclined to do everything they think to be lovely and likeable, without caring for the
consequences. Thus, it happens that a cronopio appointed as director of the local
radio station has the text of all broadcasts translated into Romanian, or that their
memories roam unhindered around their homes.

FAMAS
Precise, rigorous and efficient, famas represent the contrary of cronopios. When they
travel, they always gather detailed information about hotel rooms, taking even the
colors of carpets into account; they treat their belongings, even the most trivial ones,
WITH GREAT CARE, and do not like squandering. However, they often can also be
generous and sympathetic.

OTHER CREATURES
Despite their reciprocal differences, or maybe just due to them, cronopios and famas generally get
along together pretty well, and solid friendships between them are not uncommon. This does not 
happen with esperanzas (lit. “hopes”), which are lazy, do not like changes – they only move either
horizontally or vertically in fact – and easily become aggressive towards anyone they believe to
disturb them. Moreover, there is also a kind of bird around which feels a particular pleasure in
pecking poor cronopios’s heads.

THE GAME

A cronopio goes back home, puts his hand in his pocket to grab the door key, but finds a box of
matches instead. As usual when dealing with cronopios, nothing is where it should be…

The aim of the game is then to find the key and enter the cronopio’s house, which entrance is on
the left side of the starting location. To do this it will be necessary to use the objects scattered
around the town and interact with some characters and creatures which are to be found there. To
use an object simply have it in your inventory. Some objects will not be immediately available, but
will require some other ones to be obtained.

To pick up an object the cronopio must touch it, then the ACTION key must be pressed. Objects
can be managed by pressing the INVENTORY key: the game will be paused and the list of the
objects being carried will appear on the screen. To drop an object, select it from the list using the
UP and DOWN keys, then press ACTION. The cronopio can carry a maximum of two objects at a
time. Return to the game without dropping any object by selecting *EXIT* and pressing ACTION.

From time to time, in the lower part of the screen, words spoken by characters or useful
indications will appear. They all are marked with a certain color:

• white : words of the main character;
• green : words of other cronopios;
• red : words of famas;
• cyan : notifications of game events, placed between brackets, or words heard on the radio.

You must also avoid contact with esperanzas and birds. Every contact will deduct one unit of
energy from the bar placed above the play area. If energy drops to zero, the cronopio dies and the
game will end.

CONTROLS

In order to play the game, keys as well as Kempston or Sinclair joysticks may be used. Default keys
are:

• Q - left
• W - right
• O - up
• K- down
• P - action
• SPACE - inventory

You can choose among the various options in the start menu by pressing the corresponding key.

Keys may be redefined. If you opt for one of the joysticks, you will be required to define a key for
the INVENTORY function. Fire button will work as the ACTION key. 
The inventory will only be activated when it contains at least one object.

HINTS AND TIPS

• Cronopios y Famas is first and foremost a divertissement, an “interactive homage” to Julio
Cortázar. Many of the puzzles might seem strange or even illogical if you haven’t read
Cronopios and Famas. However, the game is structured in such a way that there is no risk of
getting into “dead ends” or making some irreparable mistake, thus forcing the player to
start all over again (except losing all of the energy, of course!).
• There is a way to restore your energy at maximum level every time you want, but you will
have to discover it by yourselves…
