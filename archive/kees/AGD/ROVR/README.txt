The Game
=========
As part of an exclusive team, you are sent into the deserts of ancient Egypt in search of vast treasures. Although you are happy to assist the boffins and their research, for you the aim of the trip is to make money.

During a quiet day, you trek into the nearby desert carrying your ROVR unit. The Remote Operated Vehicle for Recovery is ideal to get into tight passages and narrow halls, and even better to grab the treasure that may be within.

Your ROVR unit is equipped with a diamond drill, able to drill into certain rocks if required, so any debris should not be a problem.

The unit can carry only one item at a time and has a limited charge. This can be replenished once you setup the drop point.

Your luck must be in as you soon locate a small entrance above a large chamber. Slowly you lower the ROVR into place, setup the drop point and pick up your video controller.

Controlling the ROVR, you must locate and return any treasure back to the drop point in order to complete your task, get rich and live the life of a millionaire.

Playing
=======
You can control the ROVR using the keyboard (QAOP and SPACE) or by using a Kempston or Sinclair joystick.
To use the drill, you must drive into the rock and keep moving whilst running the drill.

IMPORTANT NOTE
================
This game in no way attempts to make tomb robbing acceptable or condones the selling of ancient artifacts.
IT’S A GAME!!

NOTES:
======
This game will work on 48k machines/emulators, but will have limited sound.
Emulators that support AY emulation in 48k mode should use that setting, or use 128,+2 or +3 modes.
Real 128,+2,+3 machines should work fine.
