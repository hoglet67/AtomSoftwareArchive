Gherbert Groundhog Save the Day:
--------------------------------

STORY:

Gherbert had just got his burrow laid out perfectly for his upcoming date with his sweetheart. Unfortunately his jealous crazy critter neighbours broke in and stole his belongings. With only hours to go until his big date Gherbert must venture outside to find his stuff and get back to tidy up before his date arrives at 8pm.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Find Gherberts objects and return them, one by one, to his burrow before his big date. Avoid the critters and falling acorns. Your lives are shown in the top right, with the number of objects you have collected shown next to it. The current time is shown in the top center of the screen, so keep an eye on it: Gherberts date is due at 8PM and he can't be late or it's game over!
