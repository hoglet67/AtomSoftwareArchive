First test of crappy-game development for ZX Spectrum with AGD.

Sorry, there is no story, no good script, no cohesion in the game, you are just a ball that goes up or down ðŸ˜Ž

---

Bola ke ase fulfills 2 functions:

-Learn the AGD engine, to be able to do something more decent after this game

-Finish a game that I started as a child in my +2A in BASIC (!!!!). The idea was the same as this one, with an 8x8 ball going up screens, but obviously the BASIC was too short for me, it was all very slow, and I left it.

----

CONTROLS: OPC

PENDING: points (I don't know how to do it yet) and add some music AY

THANK YOU FOR TRYING IT, any comment is welcome!
