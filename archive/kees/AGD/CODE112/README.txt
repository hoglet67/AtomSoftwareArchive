112Code:
--------

SYNOPSIS

For a long time, in a quiet town, people have not stopped disappearing. The last case being a young girl. The inhabitants think that the disappearances may be related to the new social engineering research center that they have installed in the north of the quiet town. Many have tried to enter to see what is cooking there, but no one has returned to tell the tale.
Sami, is the brother of the last case, a young girl of 6 years. Despite the obvious risk he will not give up and will enter that fearsome center to return to his sister, safe and sound.
