HOW TO PLAY

In the game, you control an archaeologist on an expedition aiming to retrieve artifacts left by an ancient and mysterious civilization. You carry a spade, which works as your primary weapon against the dangerous creatures that roam the excavation site. From level 2 on you can buy yourself a pump-action shotgun to blast the monsters into oblivion – a couple of shots will be enough to dispatch even the hardest foe! Unfortunately, it won’t work under water. Also beware the ghosts of fallen researchers whose lives have been claimed by the caves maze. You will recognize them because they look just like you but glow in the dark. They cannot be hit, so you will only be able to avoid them.
You have to find all the artifacts and bring them back to the tent in the starting screen.
Pick up artifacts by pressing the Up key or by pushing the joystick up. Press the Inventory key (available when you are carrying at least one object or artifact) and select artifacts you want to drop. You are allowed to carry a maximum of 100 units of weight. Your spade and primary oxygen reserve are always with you and do not count towards it. Artifacts found weigh 30 units each except for the Gem, which weighs 80. Items of equipment weigh 20 units each. The Gem is always kept by a mighty Dragon spitting lethal flames.
Water will make your oxygen reserve drop. If you carry an oxygen cylinder, 100 units of oxygen will be added to it. If oxygen drops under 100 while carrying the cylinder, it will be depleted and you will have to leave it behind to make room in your inventory. In levels 2 and 3 some caves will be filled with poisonous green vapors leaking from industrial waste drums illegally dumped there by crime syndicates in the previous years. You must wear a protective suit while proceeding there, otherwise your oxygen reserve will drop very fast.
You must leave the artifacts while standing beside the tent in the first screen. Once you drop all of them - 6 for the first level, 7 for the second and 8 for the third - you finish the level. If you are killed while carrying one or more artifacts, they will be dropped on the spot, except for the Gem, which will be carried back to the Dragon screen, where it can be found. Equipment items will stay in your inventory.
You gain 500 credits for each item, except for the Gem which is worth 1000, plus 200 for each life left at the time of ending the level and 10 for each unit of time left. When time reaches zero you won’t die but will lose that additional bonus. These credits will be made available as funds needed to purchase equipment before starting the following level. You won’t get any credits by eliminating enemies.
In the equipment purchase screen, cycle between the different options with Space and select one by pressing Enter. When you are satisfied with your choice, select the ? sign to exit and proceed to the next level, or the ? sign to start all over again. Prices for each item are on the right. You cannot spend an amount higher than your available funds. The amount you spent will be deducted from your budget. Remember that items are not carried over from one level to another, therefore you will have to purchase them again if you wish to keep using them. The last item of the list, Hire a researcher, grants you an extra life – if you have the necessary money, of course!

The panel on the right of the screen shows, from top to bottom:

- the number of lives left;
- the number of items brought to the tent;
- the total weight of your inventory;
- the units of oxygen left;
- the time left for the additional bonus.

The game is completed when you retrieve all the artifacts of the third level.

CONTROLS

You can control the archaeologist with the keyboard or with a Kempston or Sinclair joystick. Default keys are: O - left; P - right; Q - up; A - down; M - fire; H – inventory.
Keys are fully redefinable in the Preferences menu (see below).

THE MENUS

The game features menus controlled by means of an arrow-shaped cursor which moves by pressing the SPACE key, while the options are selected by pressing the ENTER key.
Upon loading, the initial screen will appear, with three icons, from left to right:

- Green traffic light: Start game.
- Pipe wrench: Preferences.
- Trophy: View high scores table.

In the Preferences menu, you can choose how to control the game. From left to right:

Keyboard/ Kempston joystick/ Sinclair joystick/ Redefine keys. By selecting the Redefine Keys option, the icons on the lower part of the screen will be lit up in the Left/ Right/Up/ Down/ Fire/ Inventory order. Press the corresponding key of your choice.

HINTS AND TIPS

- Artifacts won’t always appear in the same places.
- Ammunition for the shotgun is infinite; oxygen is not.
- To save time, it is advisable to carry as many artifacts as you can and leave them all at once, rather than retrieving them one by one.

TECHNICAL NOTES

The game is compatible with all ZX Spectrums with 128K RAM and is available in the following formats:

? TZX tape image file saved with the SetoLOAD turbo loading scheme, for generic emulation and loading on real hardware via PC or multimedia reader;
? TAP tape image file, for those emulators which do not support TZX files or use with a DivIDE/DivMMC interface and FATware 0.12 and its derivatives (0.12a, Velesoft etc.), or with ESXDOS 0.8.5 and newer;
? multi-language MGT disk image file for use with the Plus D interface; may be used with a ZX Spectrum 48K/+ equipped with the interface (without background music due to the lack of the AY-8912 sound chip); must be left in the drive during play;
? multi-language SCL disk image file for use with the Beta Disk interface; must be left in the drive during play;
? multi-language TRD disk image file for use with the Beta Disk or similar (e.g. Arcade AR-20, IDS-91, CBI-95) disk interfaces, or with a DivIDE/DivMMC and ESXDOS 0.8.5 and newer; may be used with a ZX Spectrum 48K/+ equipped with such interfaces (without background music due to the lack of the AY-8912 sound chip); must be left in the drive during play.

Please note: if your interface runs ESXDOS 0.8.5, you must highlight the DOOMPIT-EN.TAP file name in the ESXDOS menu, press I then SPACE and load the game by entering the usual LOAD “” command. Otherwise, when typing your name for the high scores table you will be unable to enter anything other than numbers and symbols (with SYMBOL SHIFT). This is due to a bug of the operative system, corrected in ESXDOS 0.8.6 beta 4.
