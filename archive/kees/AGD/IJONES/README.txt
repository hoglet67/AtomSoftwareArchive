Indiana Jones and the Fountain of Everlasting Life:
---------------------------------------------------

Indiana Jones and the Fountain of Everlasting Life is not a new release, but since it caught our eye, it is impossible to ignore it. In the end, there are not so many games about Indiana Jones on the ZX Spectrum - three official and six or seven amateur games.

Strictly speaking, it is difficult to call a full-fledged Fountain of Everlasting Life game - this is a quality-made, but very short platformer, released on April 1. As a regular player, he is traversed by the seconds in 50, and by the person who sees the Spectrum for the first time in his life, on the strength of 3 minutes.

It is a pity, of course, that the author did not undertake to turn this joke into a normal game - it would be great. You can try it yourself by downloading Fountain of Everlasting Life from “Perfect Pixel”.
