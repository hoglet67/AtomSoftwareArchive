ROBOTS RUMBLE (128K with music / 48k with sound):
------------------------------------------------- 

"You are Slade, 45 years old, and yes, you love your job: to destroy broken robots on distant planets and throw them into the burning lava."
"You will be sent to different planets guiding the broken robots through different scenarios, your mission, throw them into the lava with the exclusive help of two old big magnets. "
You must avoid the green stones of kryptonite (the robot will explode causing pollution of the entire planet). You must avoid the sentinels of the plant as well.
"The magnets have a limited battery charge. They can be charged by picking up the batteries on the map. If you run out of energy, you die. If both magnets are aligned with the robot, it will stop moving."
"You can use mobile platforms to fill gaps, break glass floors, climb through light lifts, use teleportation, etc."
Good luck! You will need it.

Controls:
Q - Left magnet UP
P - Left magnet DOWN
P - Right magnet UP
L - Right magnet DOWN
