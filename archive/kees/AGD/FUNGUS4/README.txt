THE SCENARIO
The prosper village of Fungiland has peacefully thrived for centuries, trading with the nearby communities. The Fungi are easy-going folks, living upon their work. But now they are going to face the hardest time of their history…
In a remote corner of a large Japanese city, a heap of old ceramics tableware, dumped among other garbage by the personnel of a local little eatery, due to a mysterious charm begins to stick together in a grotesque form… with a life of its own! Seto Taisho is born, a strange being which, embittered for having been discarded by humans, looks for a new place to live. Wandering around the world, it meets other bizarre entities, persuading them to follow it in its conquest plan… until it reaches the outskirts of Fungiland.
Aware of the incoming invasion, the Fungi gather in the main square trying to find a way to stop Seto Taisho and his army. Rescue might come from the Spinning Star, the visible sign of a strong magic energy which their ancestors knew how to utilize, but that no one is nowadays able to handle… except for one of them:

FUNKY FUNGUS!

Employed as a defense weapon in the beginning of Fungiland’s history, the Star has been put aside during the long years of absence of any conflict. Only the Fungus family was granted the privilege to keep practicing the Magic Way of the Star, a collection of rites which allow the casting of the Star’s energy against non-Fungi. Funky Fungus is the current Champion of the Way; rather eccentric even for a varied people like the Fungi (he always wears sunglasses and when he is off from work, he loves to play bass guitar in the local soul/funk band, The Fun Guys), he is nonetheless.

THE ENEMIES:

NUPPEPPO
Country of origin: Japan
Nuppeppo is a peaceful being like the Fungi, but everyone avoids him due to his nauseating body odor, which can overwhelm even Funky Fungus. Seto Taisho promised him a new land, where nobody will treat him badly for his stink anymore.

MUNACIELLO
Country of origin: Italy
‘O munaciello is the small spirit in a monk’s robe infesting many houses in Naples.
He loves wealth and is following Seto Taisho hoping to grab some new treasures.

SACI PERERE
Country of origin: Brazil
The hopping one-legged sprite, heavy pipe smoker, loves playing practical jokes and for this reason is always looking for new victims. The peaceful Fungi look like ideal targets to him, thus it was not hard for Seto Taisho to enroll him in its army.

JACK ‘O LANTERN
Country of origin: Ireland
Poor Jack is no more able to scare anyone; even children mock it as a “Halloween pumpkin”. It joined Seto Taisho with the aim of regaining its ancient prestige.

TROLL
Country of origin: Norway
The mighty Troll roams around the forest, crushing with his heavy mass everything he meets. Annoyed with the ever-increasing presence of humans (and of their reinforced concrete buildings), he followed Seto Taisho to be able to cause some unrestricted mayhem.

KARAKASA
Country of origin: Japan
Like Seto Taisho, Karakasa is an old object – namely a straw umbrella – angry for having been thrown away. Its only eye and long tongue are the features making it immediately recognizable.

BABA YAGA
Country of origin: Russia
Baba Yaga is a witch flying aboard a large mortar, where she mixes the ingredients for her concoctions. Seto Taisho promised her the power of the Spinning Star in exchange for her assistance.

SETO TAISHO
Country of origin: Japan
Without its allies, Seto Taisho will defend against Funky Fungus by letting plates and cups fall upon his head. It is a formidable enemy, but it has a weak point somewhere, too…

THE GAME:
The adventure spans across 4 worlds of 10 screens each, plus a final screen for the battle against Seto Taisho. In each screen Funky Fungus must collect the Spinning Star in order to acquire its power and attack the enemies there. The Star’s energy does not kill the foes, but sends them back to their place of origin after they have been hit a certain number of times. When all of them are banned, the next screen follows. At the same time, the power of the Star will run out and Funky Fungus will have to collect it again.
Funky Fungus starts with 5 lives, shown under his image on the right of the screen. He will lose one if he comes into contact with an enemy or if the time – shown under the hourglass placed nearby – will reach zero.

Every now and then, a disappearing foe will leave an item which will stay on screen for a short time:

SUPERCHARGE		Enhances the power of the Star considerably.
HOURGLASS		Resets the time count back to 99.
JUMPING LITTLE FUNGUS	Grants a life to Funky Fungus.
LAUGHING SKULL		Makes Funky Fungus lose a life.

Upon completing the tenth screen, the world score and total score will be presented, before entering the next world, and a bonus life will be added (due to a limitation of AGD, score resets back to zero at the start of each world). Funky Fungus may never have more than 9 lives. If all of them are lost, you will have three times the possibility to start again. If so, you will start the current world from the first screen with 5 lives and your previous score will be completely lost.
In order to play the game, keys as well as Kempston or Sinclair joysticks may be used. In the start menu the various options can be chosen by moving the arrow under each icon at the pressure of any key except ENTER, which selects the current option. From left to right, icons mean: Redefine keys and select the keyboard / Kempston joystick / Sinclair joystick / Watch the introduction again / Start the game. 

Default keys are:

  Q  - left
  W  - right
  O  - jump 
  P  - fire (activates on collecting the Star)
SPACE- pause
