ALCHEMIST II: THE DUNGEONS
--------------------------
The evil Warlock is back. The evil forces have granted him a second chance and now you're back in his dread castle to definitively defeat him but... where's Warlock?
Is there an unexplored part of the castle...? 

THE GAME
--------
Using the appropriate objects you will get the instructions to find and defeat Warlock. You can use some weapons to fight the evil creatures and the guardians at his disposal. You also need to find two magic scrolls containing the spells that will help you in your quest. You may only carry one object and or one spell at a time.

SPELLS
------
TRANSFORM: use it on a certain object at the right time (it needs at least 10 points of spell energy to work).
RESTORE: it increases your stamina.
Spell energy is restored with time. Stamina decreases with time.

FOOD BLOCKS [F]
---------------
They increase your stamina.

THE EVIL CREATURES AND THE GUARDIANS
------------------------------------
Each weapon will only be effective against a certain creature/guardian. If you don't own the right weapon, avoid contacts with creatures and guardians or you'll lose energy in the first case and die in the second.

GAME CONTROLS
-------------
It's possible to redefine the game controls.
Default controls are:

I - LEFT
O - RIGHT
Q - FLY (it turns you into an eagle)
A - PICK UP / DROP OBJECT
P - PICK UP / DROP SPELL
N - CAST SPELL

Good luck!
