THE AMERICAN WEST, 1848

Ay-yi-yi! It used to be such an easy life, being a Mexican bandit. You would cross the border into the United States, rob the gringo settlers, then race back into Mexico with your loot before their lawmen could catch you.

But Mexico just lost a war with the United States - and now your beloved Alta California has been stolen by the stinking gringos! Their sheriffs and marshals are everywhere. And worse, the loot you hid in what were safe places within Mexico is now deep inside American territory!

There are 20 sacks of loot to find. Cross the border and recover your riches. The desert is a dangerous place, but as the toughest hombre west of the Mississippi, you know how to deal with trouble...

SHOOT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES!
