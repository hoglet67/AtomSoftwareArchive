BSAVE Basic save 	BS.The command is the same as the normal SAVE statement. The program, however, gets another execution address (#AFAF inside the P-Charme). This effectively makes it possible to *RUN basic programs, that require stack, free space pointer etc. to be initialized.On the Atom Emulator and Atoms with multiple roms at #Axxx, however, it only works if P-Charme is selected.
