BGET Byta get B.This function returns a single byte from a random file. The form of the instruction is:BGET <factor>where <factor> is the file's handle returned by the FIN function. The next byte from the random file is returned as the least significant byte of the value, the other three bytes being zero. In the DOS the sequential pointer will be moved on by one and the operating system will cause an error if the pointer passes the end of the file.Example:A=FIN"FRED"PRINT "THE FIRST BYTE FROM FRED IS "BGET A'
