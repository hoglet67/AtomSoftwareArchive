TOOLBOX or UTILITY ROMThe Atom can be expanded with an additional eprom in socket 24. Some examples as a word processor application, a spreadsheet program but also many kits with new commands and statements. Over the years it seemed that one socket was not enough so there were several expansion boards designed ranging from two up to 16 roms. To enable automatic bank switching between the eproms a few systems were created like `Branquar and CX-1.Some well known toolboxes are:`PCHARME`GAGS`AW (Atomic Windows)`FPGAUTIL`JBOXSALFAAJOSBOXbut there are many, many more. Most of them are available via the Atom Software Archive.
