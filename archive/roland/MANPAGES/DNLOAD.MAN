DNLOAD <start>This statement in the FPGA Utils reads a stream of data and writes it to the specified memory. There is no handshake. The download will end if there is no data for one second. After downloading it displays the start address, end address and a `crc checksum of the received data.Example:   DNLOAD #4000This statement only works in an Atom with a `Godil installed or in the FPGA-Atom.
