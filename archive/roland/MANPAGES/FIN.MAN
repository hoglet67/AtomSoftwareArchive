FIN Find input F.In the DOS this function initialises a random file for input (with `GET `BGET and `SGET) and updating (with `PUT  `BPUT and `SPUT), and returns a number which uniquely represents the file. This 'file handle' is used in all future references to the file. Zero is returned if the file does not exist. The file handle is only a byte long (1 -- 255) and can be stored in variables or using ! or ?. Usage of a file handle not given by the operating system will result in an error. In the COS the message PLAY TAPE will be printed, and the system will wait for any key to be pressed.
