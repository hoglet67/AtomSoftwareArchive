ATTRG (VIA required)(At Trigger) As INT, this is a declaration. If the timer is running and the space bar or the fire button is depressed, the interpreter will finish the current statement and will then jump to the first statement on the ATTRG line behind the declaration.Note: The interrupt handling uses a so called map-byte, which holds all information on activated channels and ATTRG declarations. This byte at address #0237 must be 0 at startup. This can be done through BASE. If one doesn't use the BASE statement, this location must be reset manually through: ?#237=0 or INT:0  Example:     10 INT:0     20 INT 0,100 P."TWO SECONDS ELAPSED"';GOTO a     30 INT 1,800 P."MAXIMUM RUN-TIME REACHED"';INT:0;END     40 ATTRG GOTO 100     50aINT:1     60 P."DO NOTHING"';GOTO 60    100 P."ALL IS OVER"';INT:0;ENDPlease note: This program can only be run once. If you want to run it again, first press BREAK. The cause of this is that the interrupt vector is not restored by GAGS2.2. If run a second time without a BREAK, the program just keeps on going in circles.
