LINK Link to machine code subroutine LI.This statement causes execution of a machine code subroutine at a specified address. Its form is:LINK <factor>where <factor> specifies the address of the subroutine. The processor's A, X and Y registers will be initialised to the least significant bytes of the BASIC variables A, X and Y, and the decimal mode flag will be cleared. The return to the interpreter from the machine code program is via an RTS instruction. Examples:Q=TOP; !Q=06058; LINK Q; REM clear interrupt flagQ=TOP; !Q=06078; LINK Q; REM set interrupt flagLINK #FFE3;REM wait for key to be pressed
