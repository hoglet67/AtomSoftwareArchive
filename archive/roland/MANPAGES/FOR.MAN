FOR Start of FOR...NEXT loop F.This statement is the first part of the FOR...NEXT loop, which allows a section of BASIC text to be executed several times. The form of the FOR statement is:FOR (a) = (b) TO (c) STEP (d)Where(a) is the CONTROL VARIABLE which is used to test for loop completion(b) is the initial value of the control variable(c) is the limit to the value of the control variable(d) is the step size in value of the control variable for eachpass of the loop; if omitted, it is assumed to be 1.Items (b) (c) (d) are <expression>s; they are evaluated only once, when the FOR statement is encountered, and the values are stored for later reference by the `NEXT statement. No more than 11 nested FOR statements are allowed by the interpreter. Examples:FOR Z=O TO 11FOR 0=X TO YFOR U=-7 TO OFOR G=(X+1)*2 TO Y-100FOR J=O TO 9 STEP 3FOR K=X+1 TO Y+2 STEP IFOR Q=-10*ABSX TO -20*ABSY STEP -ABSQ
