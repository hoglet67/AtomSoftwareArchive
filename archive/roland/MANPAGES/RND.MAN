RND Random number R.This function returns a random number between -2147483648 and 2147483647, generated from a 32 bit pseudo-random binary sequence generator which will only repeat after over eight thousand million calls. The sequence is not initialised on entering the interpreter, but locations 8 to 12 contain the seed, and can be set using '!' to a chosen startinq point. To produce random numbers in some range A to B use:ABSRND%(B-A)+A
