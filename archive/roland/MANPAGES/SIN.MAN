SINSIN can be used both as a statement and a function. As a function it is part of the Floating Point rom and it returns the sine of its argument.As a statement it is part of the FPGA Utils and redirects the input stream to the serial port, reading all input from the serial port instead of the keyboard.Examples:   FPRINT SIN(1)            %S=SIN(PI)This statement only works in an Atom with a `Godil installed or in the FPGA-Atom.
