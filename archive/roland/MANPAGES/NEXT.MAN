NEXT Terminator of FOR...NEXT loop N.This statement is half of the FOR...NEXT control loop. When the word NEXT is encountered, the interpreter increases the value of the control variable by the step size, and if the control variable has not exceeded the loop termination value control is transfered back to the statement after the `FOR statement; otherwise exa''tion proceeds to the statement after the NEXT statement. The NEXT statement optionally takes a <variable> which will cause a return to the same level of nesting as the FOR statement with the same control variable, or an error if no such FOR statement is active. Examples:@=2FOR Z=O TO 9; PRINT Z; NEXT; PRINT'O 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9FOR Z=O TO 9 STEP 2; PRINT Z; NEXT Z;PRINT'O 2 4 6 8FOR Z=O TO 9; PRINT Z; NEXT YOERROR 230>
