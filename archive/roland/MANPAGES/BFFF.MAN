#BFFF Bank Switch RegisterThis register selects one of the available 4K banks at #Axxx, so you can install more then one `toolbox in your Atom. In old Atoms with an Eprom board of the Dutch Atom User Group this register was write only and a copy of its contents were stored in a shadow byte. This could be any free address. The AtoMMC rom contains `branquar as an automatic switching system between these utility roms. Branquar uses the zeropage address #FD as shadow byte.bit 0 ... 4  bank selectorsbit 5        used by branquar as 'lock' bitbit 6        not usedbit 7        not usedSome systems use bit 7 for soft switching write protect on and off.
