SGET String get S.This statement reads a string from a random file. The form of the statement is:SGET <factor>, <expression>where <factor> is the file's handle returned by the `FIN function. The <expression> is evaluated to form an address, and bytes are taken from the sequential input file and put in memory at consecutive locations starting at that address, until a 'return' is read. The sequential input file's pointer will be moved on by the length of the string plus one and the operating system will cause an error if the pointer passes the end of the input file.
