DIM Dimension statement DIMThis statement automatically allocates space after the end of the text for arrays or strings. DIM causes an error if used in direct mode. Associated with DIM is a 16 bit location referred to as the 'free space pointer'. The RUN statement sets this pointer to the value of TOP. A declaration:DIM A(Q)sets A to the current value of the free space pointer, and the pointer is moved up by (Q+1) bytes. A declaration:DIM AA(Q)allocates space for an array AA with elements AA(0) to AA(Q), and moves the value of the free space pointer up by 4*(Q+1) bytes. A special use of DIM is to set the value of P for assembling:DIM P(-1)sets P to the current value of the free space pointer, without changing the pointer's value. Several items may be dimensioned in one DIM statement:DIM A(2),AA 45,BB(67),CC(F)
