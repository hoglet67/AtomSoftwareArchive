CLEAR Clear graphics screen CLEARThis statement clears the screen and initialises the display for the graphics mode specified its argument:CLEAR O : Screen is 64*48 (semi-graphics mode)CLEAR 1 : Screen is 128*64CLEAR 2 : Screen is 128*96CLEAR 3 : Screen is 128*192CLEAR 4 : Screen is 256*192In graphics modes 1 to 4 an error will be caused if the text space and graphics area conflict.The ATOM provides nine different graphics modes, up to a resolution of 256x192 in black and white, and 128x192 in four selectable colours. The graphics modes use the `BASIC statements `PLOT, `DRAW, and `MOVE in an identical way. All the black-and-white graphics commands are present  in the unexpanded ATOM, although extra memory will be required for the  higher-resolution graphics modes. Colour plotting requires the addition of an assembler routine, or the `COLOUR statement provided in the floating point extension ROM ( `FPROM ).The nine graphics modes are listed below:Mode: Resolution: Memory:      X: Y:0     64 48       0.5 K    B/W1a    64 64       1 K      COL1    128 64       1 K      B/W2a   128 64       2 K      COL2    128 96       1.5 K    B/W3a   128 96       3 K      COL3    128 192      3 K      B/W4a   128 192      6 K      COL4    256 192      6 K      B/W
