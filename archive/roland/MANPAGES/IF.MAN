If `TRUE (non-zero) the remainder of the line will be interpreted; if `FALSE (zero) execution will continue on the next line.

Any statement, provided that the statement does not begin with T or a unary operator '!' or '?'.Examples:IF A<3 AND B>4 THEN C=26IF A<3 IF B>4 C=26; REM equivalent condition to abaveIF A>3 OR B<4 THEN C=22; REM complementary condition to aboveIF A>3 AND $S="FRED" OR C=22; REM AND and OR have equal priority
