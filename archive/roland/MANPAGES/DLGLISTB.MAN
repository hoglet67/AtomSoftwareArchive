DLGLISTBOX <ExitCode>,<Var>,<x>,<y>,<w>,<h>,<MaxRec>,<Pointer>Places a rectangle at position <x>,<y> with width <w> and height <h>, and attached to it a scrollbar. In the rectangle strings, defined in the array <Var>, are placed. The format of the array is as follows:Selected string + 0Dh,1 byte with number of strings in array,1 byte with stringnumber of first string in window,1 byte with stringnumber of selected string,First string in array + 0Dh,Second string in array + 0Dh,....MaxRec string in array + 0Dh.Whenever the [up-arrow] in the scrollbar is clicked, all strings are scrolled down one position, and vice versa for the [down-arrow]. If one clicks on a string inside the rectangle, it will be selected and transferred to the selected string. <Var> therefore always holds the latest selected string.
