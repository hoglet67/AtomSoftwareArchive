FPROM - Floating Point RomThe ATOM's `BASIC can be extended to provide  floating-point arithmetic, and  many scientific  functions, simply  by inserting  an extra  4K ROM chip  into  a  socket  on the  ATOM board  (see Technical  Manual). The floating-point extension adds 27  new variables,  %@ and  %A to  %Z, 27 floating-point arrays %@@  and %AA  to %ZZ,  and the  following special statements and  functions to  the existing  integer BASIC,  including a statement for plotting in the ATOM's four-colour graphics modes:`ABS      `EXP      `FPRINT   `RAD`ACS      `FDIM     `FPUT     `SGN`ASN      `FGET     `FUNTIL   `SQR `ATN      `FIF      `HTN      `STR  `COLOUR   `FINPUT   `LOG      `TAN `DEG      `FLT      `PI       `VAL
