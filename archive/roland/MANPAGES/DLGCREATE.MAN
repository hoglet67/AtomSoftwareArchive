DLGCREATE <ExitVar>,<Text$>,<Style>,<x>,<y>,<w>,<h>Defines a Window on position <x>,<y> with width <w> and height <h>, titled <Text$>. Whenever a selection is made, and the interaction mode is exited the selection (ExitCode) is transferred to <ExitVar>. <Style> allows the following options for <Text$> (which by the way applies to all other objects as well):    bit 7 : Place a CANCEL button (DLGCREATE only),    bit 6 : Place an OK button (DLGCREATE only),    bit 5 : Double height,    bit 4 : Greyscale, selectable objects are then no longer selectable,    bit 3 : Invert,    bit 2 : Underline,    bit 1 : Italic,    bit 0 : Bold.  Combinations of several bits are allowed. If, for example, you'd like a bold, inverted text, select Style = 1 + 8 = 9.
