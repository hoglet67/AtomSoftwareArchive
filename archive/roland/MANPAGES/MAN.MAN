MANThe Atom Manual Pages provide an electronic documentation system for the Acorn Atom. By typing MAN with a keyword you get some documentation on your screen. If there is a special marked word in the text then this is also a keyword.From this page on you can start for example with some keywords like:	`BASIC	`FPROM	`TOOLBOX	`HARDWARE    You can easily add your own manpages by creating a simple textfile in the /MANPAGES directory of your AtoMMC card. The name of the page should not exceed eight characters. This is a limitation of the FAT system. The extension of the file is .MAN. If you type a back tick just before a keyword then it will be interpreted as such. The best way is to save the file with #0D as line end, although #0A characters will be ignored.Don't bother about line breaks. The MAN statement will render the page on 32 or 80 column screens.
