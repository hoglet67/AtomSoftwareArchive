PLOT Plot statement PLOTThis statement takes three arguments: a parameter that determines how to plot, and a pair of relative or absolute cartesian coordinates. The first parameter is as follows:O plot line relative to last point with no change in pixels1 as O but set pixels2 as O but invert pixels3 as O but clear pixels4 plot line to absolute position with no change in pixels5 as 4 but set pixels6 as 4 but invert pixels7 as 4 but clear pixels8 plot point relative to last point with no change in pixel9 as 8 but set pixel10 as 8 but invert pixel11 as 8 but clear pixel12 plot point at absolute position with no change in pixel13 as 12 but set pixel14 as 12 but invert pixel15 as 12 but clear pixelBefore using the PLOT statement (or the `MOVE and `DRAW equivalents) the graphics mode has to be initialized with the `CLEAR statement.
