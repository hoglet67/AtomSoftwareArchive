PROGRAM Program heading 	 Behind this statement there is room for a name. The rest of the line is regarded as comment. Besides giving a name to a program, the following features are supported:1. Automatical RESTORE at the start of the program,2. Initialization of procedures and functions,3. Initialization of built-in functions (INSTR, EVEN etc),4. Initialization of error pointer routines,5. Initialization of multi-dimensional arrays,6. Initialization of WHILE loops,7. Recognition for the CAT statement.Item 2 effectively fills the area #28DD-#28FF with #00. This area is NOT used by the floating point ROM. For Item 3, 4 and 5 the BRKVEC is changed for the duration of the program. A correct program name begins with two different characters. Here are some examples:10 PROGRAM TEST VERSIE IV - the name here is 'TEST'10 PROGRAM CRC-TEST - the name here is 'CRC-TEST'10 PROGRAM QS(QUICK START) - the name here is 'QS'10 PROGRAM -A Anemometer - the name here is '-A'If the program is resident in the memory area #1000-#9FFF and if there's one space between the NOT abbreviated statement PROGRAM and the line number the program name is automatically promoted to a statement.Typing a program name results in searching the memory for that program, initializing the labels, clearing the FOR-NEXT, DO-UNTIL and GOSUB-stacks, setting the value of TOP and starting the program.
