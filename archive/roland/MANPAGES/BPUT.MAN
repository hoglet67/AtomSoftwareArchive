BPUT Byte put B.This statement sends a single byte to a random file. The form of the statement is:BPUT <factor>, <expression>where <factor> is the file's handle returned by the FOUT function; the <expression> is evaluated and its least significant byte is sent to the random file. If you are using the DOS, the random file's sequential pointer will be moved on by one and the operating system will cause an error if the length of the file exceeds the space allowed. Example:A=FOUT"FRED"BPUT A, 23
