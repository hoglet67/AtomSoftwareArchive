SPUT String put SP.This statement writes a string to a random file. The form of the instruction is:SPUT <factor> <string right>where <factor> is the file's handle returned by the `FOUT function. Every byte of the string, including the terminating 'return' character, is sent to the file. In the DOS the random file's sequential pointer will be moved on by the length of the string plus one, and the operating system will cause an error if the length of the file exceeds the space allowed.Example:A=FOUT"FRED"SPUT A , "THIS IS FILE FRED"
