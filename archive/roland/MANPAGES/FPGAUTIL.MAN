FPGAUTILThis toolbox is written by David Banks and was originally written for the FPGA-Atom. Many statements also work in an Atom with a `GODIL video interface.The toolbox provides the following statements:`FHELP                          Shows short help text`BAUD                           Sets baudrate of serial port`SIN                            Redirects OSRDCH to serial port`SOUT                           Redirects OSWRCH to serial port`SINOUT                         Redirects OSRDCH and OSWRCH to serial port`UPLOAD                         Sends a file to serial port`DNLOAD                         Receives a file from serial port`CRC                            Calculates a checksum`VGA80                          80 x 40 character video driver`MAN                            Manual command (help system)`BEEP                           Switches to BBC Basic mode`FLASH                          Programs a block of flash ROM`RLIST                          Lists all available toolboxes in romThe statements BEEP, FLASH and RLIST are not implemented in the Atom2k15 edition. This edition has a more sophisticated version of the VGA80 driver.
