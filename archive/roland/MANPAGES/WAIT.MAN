WAIT Wait statement WAITThis statement waits until the next 60 Hz vertical sync pulse from the CRT controller. The statement has two uses: to give a delay of one sixtieth of a second, and to wait until flyback so that a subsequent graphics command will not cause noise on the screen. Examples:FOR Z=l TO 60; WAIT; NEXT; REM wait a second.MOVE 0,0; WAIT; DRAW 8,8; REM noise-free plotting
