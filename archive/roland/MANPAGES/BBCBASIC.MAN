BBCBASICThe Atom has many ways to run BBC-BASIC. The oldest and hardest way is to install an Acorn BBC Basic conversion board into the Atom. Modern Atoms have soft-skills to run BBC Basic.J.G. Harston has written a "stand alone" BBC Basic interpreter that can be loaded and then you have BBC Basic available without any hardware modifications. This program is called ATBASIC2 and it requires 32 KB of RAM memory from #0000 - #7FFF.On the Atom2k14 you can also run *BBC (from the \BBC folder). This loads the BBC Basic ROM and Interpreter into the Atom memory. This version is automatically restarted when BREAK is pressed. You can return to Atom Basic by entering ?&BFFE=0 and then press the break key. Re-run the system init routine to load the Atom roms again.If the Atom has an LX9CoPro fitted you can also run BBC Basic on the CoPro. There are three versions available:65C102: run BASIC2 or HIBASICZ80:  : run Z80ROMPDP11 : run PDPRM23
