ABS Absolute value A.This function returns the absolute value of its argument, which is a <factor>. ABS will fail to take the absolute value of the maximum negative integer, -2147483648, since this has no corresponding positive value. The most common use of ABS is in conjunction with RND to produce random numbers in a specified range, see RND. If the floating point extension ROM is installed, ABS can also take a floating point argument.Examples:PRINT ABS-1,ABS(-1),ABS1,ABS(1)'1 1 1 1FPRINT ABS -2.22.20000000
