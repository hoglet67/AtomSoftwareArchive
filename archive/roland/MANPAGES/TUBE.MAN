*TUBE [<cpu>]  Tube Host Client for the LX9CoPro boardThis is an external program that communicates with the selected CPU. It is advised to run this program in a 80 column display mode with support for upper and lower case characters like the `GODIL or EF9345-based board (untested). The program accepts an optional argument which should be an integer number between 0 and 15. It will select the according CPU core. The CPU cores are listed in this table:N   CPU     CLOCK  MEMORY---------------------------0   65C102  4MHz   64KB int1   65C102  8MHz   64KB int2   65C102 16MHz   64KB int3   65C102 32MHz   64KB int4   Z80     8MHz   64KB ext5   Z80    32MHz   64KB int6   Z80    56MHz   64KB int7   Z80   112MHz   64KB int8   80286  16Mhz  896KB ext9   6809    4MHz   64KB ext10  68000  16MHz    1MB ext11  PDP11  32MHz   64KB int12  ARM2   32MHz    2MB ext13  32016  32MHz    2MB ext14  Null / SPI Raspberry Pi15  BIST 		For then Atom you can run `BBCBASIC on the 65C102, Z80 and PDP11 cores. You can also run `CPM (Z80 core) and `FLEX (6809 core).
