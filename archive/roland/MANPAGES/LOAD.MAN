LOAD Load BASIC program LO.This command will load a BASIC program into the current text area. Tts form is:LOAD <string right>and it will pass the string to the operating system and request the operating system to complete the transfer before returning (in case the transfer is by interrupt or direct memory access). Then the text area is scanned through to set the value of TOP; if the file was machine code or data and not a valid BASIC program the prompt may not reappear. Example:LOAD"FRED"
