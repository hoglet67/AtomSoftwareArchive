COLOUR The floating point extension ROM also contains routines for plotting in the colour graphics modes. The following colour graphics modes are available:Mode:    Resolution:   Memory:         X:       Y:1a       64       64   1 K2a      128       64   2 K3a      128       96   3 K4a      128      192   6 KThe  graphics  modes  are  obtained  by  specifying  the  `CLEAR  statement followed  by  the  mode  number  (without   the   'a'),   and   the COLOUR statement to determine which  colour is  to be  plotted. The  parameter to the COLOUR  statement determines  the colour  as follows;  on a  black and white television or monitor  the colours  will be  displayed as  shades of grey:Value:   Colour:   Grey scale:O        Green     Grey1        Yellow    White2        Blue      Black3        Red       BlackCOLOUR O corresponds to the background colour.When  a  colour  has  been  specified,  all subsequent  `DRAW statements will  draw  lines  in  that colour.  The `PLOT  statement will  'set' lines and  points  in  that  colour,  will  always   â€™clear'  to   the  background colour,  and  will  always  'invert'  to  a  different  colour, irrespective of the current COLOUR.
