FOUT Find output FO.In the DOS this function initialises a random file for output (with `PUT `BPUT and `SPUT), and returns a number which uniquely specifies the output file. This 'file handle' is used in all future references to the file. Zero will be returned there is a problem associated with using the file as an output file; e.g.:(a) write protected file(b) write protected disc(c) insufficient space in directory(d) file already in use as an input file(e) insufficient memory spaceThe number returned is only a byte long (1-255) and can be stored in variables or using ! or ?. Usage of a number not given by the operating system will result in an error. In the COS the message RECORD TAPE will be printed, and any keywaited for.Example:A=FOUT"FRED"IF A=O PRINT 'WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FRED"'
