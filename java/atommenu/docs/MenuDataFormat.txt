MENU DATA FILES
===============

We have ended up with two files:

MNU/SORTDAT - Is a series of pointer tables sorting the main title records in various orders. This currently loads to #3600 and is #05E0 long (1504 bytes).

MNU/MENUDAT - Is this main table (one row per title), plus secondary tables for Short Publisher Names, Publisher Names, Genres and Collections. This currently loads to #8200 and is #0E11 long (3601 bytes).

The sizes are for V2 of the Atom Software Archive, which has 186 titles.

More details, in case anyone else want to have a play....
